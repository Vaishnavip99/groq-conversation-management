ASSISTANT: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and improve their performance over time. The primary goal of machine learning is to develop systems that can automatically improve their capabilities and adapt to new situations without being explicitly programmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Machine learning models are trained on large datasets, which allows them to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data. This training process enables the model to learn from experience and make predictions or decisions based on the data it has been trained on.\n",
